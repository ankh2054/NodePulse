NodePulse Documentation

NodePulse is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to help developers maintain and utilize a list of healthy nodes (such as Hyperion or Atomic API nodes). The library connects to an API that provides a list of healthy nodes, which it regularly refreshes, and can fallback to a predefined list of default nodes in case of API failure.
